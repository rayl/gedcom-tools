A set of tools to parse and manipulate GEDCOM 5.5 files.

Actually, this is just a vehicle to explore Parsec.  For now, it's a
simple, semi-complete validator. It purports to read in a GEDCOM 5.5
file and check that the levels and tags form a valid record
structure. Cross refs and detailed line values are not really examined
at the moment.

One big problem is that the record bodies are monads.  the do-notation
allows the structure parsers to almost mirror the indented syntax
definitions in the spec document, which is very nice.  However, it
also imposes an ordering on sub-records, while the spec states that
ordering is not important between different tags at the same level.
Not sure if there's a way to relax the ordering while keeping the nice
indenting structure...
